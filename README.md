# GeometricJungle
We plan to make a 2D tower defense/battle arena game mechanically based on the game Clash Royale (website found here) and aesthetically based on the Geometry Wars series (example game found here) and some mechanics from the Plants vs Zombies series. In this game, the player will control a series of geometrical “towers” alongside procedurally spawned “underlings” and a randomly picked list of various heroes to use against a single enemy (AI-controlled, or Human) which is set on the opposite side of a given “arena” playing area in the game. Each character’s spawned minions and enemies will walk towards and begin attacking the closest enemies and towers. The objective of the game is to completely destroy the enemy’s towers to collect money, points, and end the game.
